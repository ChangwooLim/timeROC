Special thanks :
-----------------------------

I warmly thank Thomas A. Gerds for his very useful R package Refresh which we used a hundred times to re-build and/or check timeROC. 
Refresh can be downloaded at: http://192.38.117.59/~tag/research/Rontology/Refresh-snps.html

I warmly thank Ulla Brasch Mogensen for her help to improve the help documentation.

I also thank Jean-Francois Dartigues, head of the PAQUID epidemiological study, for having provided the Paquid data.
